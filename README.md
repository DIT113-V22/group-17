## What are we going to create?

We are creating an android application that can be used to control a smart car remotely. The app will allow users to control their cars while watching a live stream of the surroundings. The car can also detect and avoid obstacles(by stopping) in its path using built-in sensors for safe driving.
 
## Why are we doing this?

The main objective is to allow users to control their cars remotely through an android app on their phones. The obstacle detection and avoidance also helps reduce human errors that could arise while driving and the speed limiter will prevent the driver from exceeding speed limits. 

## How are we going to do this?

We will be developing the android app in Android Studio using java. The car functionality is coded in Arduino IDE using C++ and can be emulated in the SMCE emulator. We are using the Mosquitto broker to establish an MQTT connection between the android app and the arduino file. The city environment is created in the Godot Engine to help with obstacle avoidance. Lastly, we will be using GitHub for collaborating on the project.
