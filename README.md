# Group-17
We will create an app which will assist the user in parking their autonomous car.
- The app will tackle issues such as parallel parking.
- If time allows it then we will create additional systems so the car can locate and park in a parking lot by itself.

**Why?**
- People in general have problems with parallel parking so we think this niche might be very helpful.
- Having the car park for itself would allow the user to avoid stress in situations where he might be pressed for time.

**How?**
- We will use the sensors to make sure the car doesnâ€™t hit another car whilst parking.
- Using the sensors the car will be able to find an unoccupied slot and park in it.

**The technology we're gonna use:**
- Arduino car
- SMCE emulator, SmartCar API, Arduino IDE
- C++, Kotlin, Java, Android Studio
